# TORTOISE LINUX

 As much of this project has not yet come to fruition, in this README I would like to explain a lot of what I am idealizing for the project, so that you, user or developer, can know what direction is set for distribution until your ideas get off the ground and reach a stable version.

 I'm making a lot of progress in this regard, I already have an ISO for testing the operating system :) 

 If you like the ideas said here and have more, open an issue.  I will be extremely happy with your collaboration :) <3

 ## What is tortoise

 Tortoise is a small project by a programming student and Linux lover, in order to understand how an operating system works and in the process use all the learning to create tools that help in the development process.

 the goal is to design a system focused on software developers while not hiding concepts and complexities of the system.  It is important that programmers know how the systems for which they are developing their tools work.  For this reason, the system user will always be encouraged to read the tools' documentation and also develop them.

 ## Supported languages

 So far, tortoise tools are written in shell script, but in the future I intend to support tools that are created in different languages 

 so far it is listed as a language possibility:

 * rust
 * c++

 ## graphic interface

 Tortoise already has a testable image and a little of what the system will look like.  At the moment the interfaces we have are i3wm and KDE, but as the system will leave it up to the user to shape the system in the way they feel comfortable, I believe it would be very interesting to provide at least one way to quickly download the interfaces for the your system.  I'm working on this idea!
 ## customizations in tortoise

 You might even think that this thing of keeping the interface as close to the standard and letting the user shape it their way will cause a lot of time to be wasted, and it would be if you weren't also working on a tool to help with this.  All this being very honest.  In the future, the user must create their customizations and save them in a safe place.  This tool that I'm calling sysconf will be in charge of downloading the necessary utilities for the configurations and also moving the configuration files to their proper place.

 ## next steps

 Now that you understand some of the purposes of the distribution, I suggest looking at the repositories we have so far, reading the issues and maybe even contributing!  I'm sure we'll learn a lot together :)

 hugs, welly <3
